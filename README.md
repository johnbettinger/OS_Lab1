# System Calls Lab

This lab was an exercise to practice Linus system calls using the POSIX standard. 

This repo contains all the code used for the Operating Systems first lab. It is divided between in the following directories: 
+ Binaries: Contains the binaries that are generated from the .c files. In order to generate all the binaries together the createbin.zsh or createbin.sh files can be used.
+ src: This file contains all the information that will be later zipped and sent as the final delivery. The createzip.zsh or createzip.sh are scripts used to generate the .zip
with the proper name and containing the files we were asked for.
  + Inside this directory are the .c scripts developed as well as the makefile for the pythoncheker.py
